## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2E3192) to convey trust, authority, and intelligence, appropriate for a legal context.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F2F5), close in hue to the primary, to keep a professional but calm presence.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#8E44AD), also close in hue, used sparingly for highlights, calls to action, and important notifications, balancing the seriousness of the primary.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its readability and modern, neutral appearance, paired with 'Playfair' for a high-end feel on the headers.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Crisp, minimalist icons from a consistent set to represent data types, actions, and navigation items.
- Clean and structured layout with a clear hierarchy, using white space effectively to improve readability and reduce visual clutter.
